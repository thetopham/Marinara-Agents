# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability that could expose user data or execute code. Use the repository's **Security** tab to submit a private vulnerability report. Include the affected package or publishing path, the Engine version, reproduction steps, and the impact.

## Package trust model

Marinara Agent packages may contain server and client entrypoints. Server entrypoints run inside the Marinara Engine process; manifest permissions describe intended access but are not an operating-system sandbox. Treat every package, artifact, catalog entry, build script, and publishing workflow as executable supply-chain material.

Catalog SHA-256 values detect accidental corruption and mismatched downloads. They do not protect against an attacker who can change both an artifact and its catalog hash. The repository therefore also:

- requires canonical same-repository artifact URLs during catalog validation;
- maps security-sensitive paths to a maintainer in `CODEOWNERS`;
- validates source manifests, archive contents, file hashes, catalog lanes, and generated outputs in pull requests; and
- pins third-party GitHub Actions by full commit SHA.

Repository administrators should keep both `staging` and `main` protected with pull requests required, Code Owner review required, stale approvals dismissed after new commits, the catalog validation check required, force pushes and branch deletion disabled, and administrator bypass restricted. `CODEOWNERS` requests review, but GitHub enforces it only when the matching branch-protection or ruleset option is enabled.

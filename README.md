# Marinara Agents

Official downloadable agents and capability packages for [Marinara Engine](https://github.com/Pasta-Devs/Marinara-Engine).

Marinara Engine starts lightweight: a fresh installation contains no optional agents. Open **Agents → Download Agents** on desktop or mobile to browse this catalog, read what each package does, and install only the features you want. Installed packages appear in the normal Agents panel and the chat modes they support. You can update or uninstall them from the same catalog. Restart Marinara Engine when the installer asks you to do so.

Across its Engine compatibility lanes, the catalog currently contains **31 first-party packages** for **Marinara Engine v2.3.0+**: 6 Writer Agents, 8 Tracker Agents, and 17 Misc Agents. Storyboard requires **Marinara Engine v2.3.5** and supports versions below **v3.0.0**. Each Engine release sees only the packages compatible with its major version. Users upgrading from an older Engine keep every feature that was available before the package split. Migration downloads matching packages once and preserves existing chat selections, agent settings, runtime data, and history.

## Official catalog

The repository publishes two coordinated channels. Marinara Engine `staging` consumes the Agents `staging` catalog for beta testing, while Engine `main` and tagged releases consume the Agents `main` production catalog. Package changes land in `staging` first and are promoted to `main` only after their generated catalog URLs are normalized to the production channel.

## Package trust and storage

The Engine downloads only entries from its Engine-major lane in this official HTTPS catalog, validates the catalog schema, checks Engine version compatibility, verifies the archive SHA-256 checksum, rejects unsafe archive paths and undeclared files, validates each declared file hash and size, and installs atomically into the Engine data directory. Installed packages remain available offline. Server-capability packages run with their declared permissions and require a restart when their runtime changes.

Package source and reproducible build scripts live in this repository instead of the base Engine distribution. Generated artifacts are published under [`artifacts/`](artifacts/), package manifests under [`packages/`](packages/), and machine-readable catalogs under [`catalog/`](catalog/). Engine 2 uses [`catalog/v2/catalog.json`](catalog/v2/catalog.json), Engine 3 uses [`catalog/v3/catalog.json`](catalog/v3/catalog.json), and [`catalog/catalog.json`](catalog/catalog.json) remains the legacy Engine 2 alias.

Catalog entries classify packages as `writer`, `tracker`, or `misc`. Every official package has a square Professor Mari cover under [`artwork/agent-covers/`](artwork/agent-covers/), published through its HTTPS `iconUrl`; Marinara displays that artwork in Download Agents and falls back to the Agents star icon when artwork is unavailable. Agent code does not need to be repackaged when catalog artwork changes.

Conversation mode's About Me profile and `update_about_me` tool are built into Marinara Engine. They are not agents and must not be published in this catalog.

## Contributing

Agent ideas, bugs, documentation corrections, and package improvements are welcome. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before starting: contributions begin with an issue, target the `staging` branch, must be marked ready for review, and require an approving review before merge. CodeRabbit automatically reviews ready pull requests.

## Maintainer build

Build the shared package snapshot and all feature bundles from a neighboring Marinara Engine checkout:

```bash
node scripts/build-agent-catalog.mjs
node scripts/build-feature-packages.mjs
node scripts/validate-catalog.mjs
```

The build records generic Engine source dependencies needed by feature packages under `sources/engine`. Package-owned implementations stay with their package; for example, Hierarchical Maps and Long-Term Memory source live under their respective `packages/<id>/src/engine/` trees and are overlaid on those generic dependencies during each build.
